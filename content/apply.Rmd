SIPPS 2022 will run from the week of <u>June 6 through August 12</u>. 

Please note that this program is specifically designed for students with little to no prior research experience, and for students from marginalized and underrepresented communities. <u>There are no coursework, minimum GPA, or prior experience requirements.</u>
