The SIPPS team comprises a group of graduate students, post-docs, undergraduates, and faculty advisors who are committed to diversity and inclusion, in its [broadest sense](https://gsas.columbia.edu/our-intellectual-community/diversity-inclusion/statement-diversity-and-inclusion){target="_blank"}. We are scientists whose day-to-day research seeks to understand how people think, behave, and relate to one other and how differences in our experiences, both positive and adverse, affect our brain, relationships, and behavior. Our work encompasses and embraces the ideas of diversity and support. The success of SIPPS and our research in general depends on including and respecting people with diverse backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences. We have the privilege and responsibility of maintaining a program that promotes the well-being and excellence of all who participate in SIPPS and everyone we encounter. Our aim is to create a space where People of Color and/or from marginalized or underrepresented groups can work together and thrive from mentorship and resources to support students in all of their endeavors, both personally and in the world of research.

#### Motivation for the program:
<ul>
<li>Increase <b>access</b> to research opportunities for undergraduate and post-bacc students who have little to no prior research experience
<li>Provide professional development and one-on-one mentoring opportunities in a safe, supportive environment
<li>Equip students with <b>practical</b> research skills
<li>Create student <b>leadership</b> opportunities
<li>Increase <b>representation</b> of diverse perspectives in psychological science
</ul>
<br>

#### We hope that after participating in SIPPS, students will:
<ul>
<li>Acquire a toolbox of research skills including knowledge on how to: conduct a literature review, understand research articles, generate research questions/hypotheses, use R for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, administer surveys on Qualtrics, create behavioral tasks in Psychopy, use online data collection tools, and practice reproducible science.
<li>Complete a research project by conducting a secondary analysis of existing data with the guidance of their primary mentors and near-peer mentors to help demystify the research process. 
<li>Learn to communicate their research to the public and academics through reproducible science practices and sessions that focus on science communication. 
<li>Articulate the issues of diversity and representation in psychology and neuroscience, explain how bias is perpetuated in research practices, and recognize the importance of diverse perspectives in science.
</ul>
