<h4>Before the workshop:</h4>
<p>
Before the workshop, please install R and RStudio on your computer. We have compiled this assortment of videos (not made by SIPPS instructors) that go over how to install these programs in Mac &amp; PC, as well as introduce you to the RStudio environment.
<p>
Installation:
