## Goals of this challenge

Students will test their understanding of:

1. How to open data in R
2. How to check for missing or problematic data and address issues.
3. How to filter, rearrange and shape data in preparation for analysis.

## Your turn!

Now it's your turn to try opening and cleaning a new data set. There are issues with the raw data, so make sure to inspect the variables and make changes when needed. Below is a rough outline to follow, try to get as far as you can.

NOTE: This is the key for the data challenge, so it has all the code already. If you haven't done the challenge, go to the blank version and try doing it on your own. If you are using this key to check your work, remembere that there are many ways to do things in R, so what you did might not be what we did here, but it can still be right (it might even be better!).


## Open and visually inspect the data

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

# Read the data into R. The file is called "Study2_Subjects.csv". Check out the separate "README_Study2.txt" file for information on the study and variables.

getwd()

list.files()

subjects <- read.csv("Study2_Subjects.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# View the first 5 rows of the data frame

head(subjects, 5)

# Examine the data for issues. Some things to look for: are the column names logical? Are there missing values? Do the variable types make sense? (ie does everything that's a factor make sense as a factor, and does everything that's numeric make sense as numeric?) Are there values that don't make sense? Fix any issues you find.

# check for missing values
subjects[!complete.cases(subjects),]

```

## Correcting data issues

Remember to check the README for additional information on the data that may help you decide what needs to be fixed.

```{r}

#Condition variable has a missing data point for sub 9. 

subjects$Condition[subjects$ID==9] <- "C"

#The variables Q1, Q2 and Q3 don't have useful names, update them to something useful

subjects <- subjects %>% 
  rename(Anxiety = Q1, Depression = Q2, Stress = Q3) %>% 
  select(ID, Condition, Age, everything())

# The sex variable is coded in a non-intuitive way, change to male/female and make it a factor
subjects <- subjects %>%
  mutate(Sex = recode_factor(Sex, '1' = 'Female', '2' = 'Male'))

```

## Rearranging our dataset

```{r}
# Rearrange the columns of the dataset to ensure the first columns are: ID, Condition, Age, Sex

subjects <- subjects %>% dplyr::select(ID, Condition, Age, Sex, everything())

# Then, sort the dataset in asecending order based on the Condition variable

subjects <- subjects %>% dplyr::arrange(Condition)

# Display the first 5 rows of the dataset to ensure your changes have been applied
head(subjects, 5)

```

## Create new variables

```{r}

# Make a new column that gives us age in months instead of years
subjects <- subjects %>% 
  mutate(Age.m = Age*12)

# Each subject in this study filled out three related questionnaires, but these scores can be combined into a composite score by taking the mean. Create a new variable for this score.

subjects <- subjects %>% 
  mutate(Composite = rowMeans(cbind(Anxiety, Depression, Stress)))

# Make an new column composed of the mean centered Z scores of the composite score column we just created
# Don't forget to convert this new data back into a numeric variable

subjects <- subjects %>% dplyr::mutate(CompositeZ = scale(Composite, center=TRUE, scale=TRUE),
        CompositeZ = as.numeric(CompositeZ))

# Take a peek at your dataset to look at the new changes
head(subjects)

```

## Combine two data sets together and reshape

```{r}

# You see there's another .csv file for Study 2, this one's called Study2_Trials.csv. Open it and take a look. This frame has the same 10 subjects, but now it has reaction time data from a task with 30 trials. Create a new data frame that combines this with your subject level information. 

trials <- read.csv("Study2_Trials.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

data <- merge(subjects, trials, by="ID")

# Now that you have one frame with all the data, put it into long format. Each subject should have one row for each trial.

data_Long <- data %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("RT"),
               names_to = "Trial",
               values_to = "RT",
               names_prefix = "RT_")

# You want to do a separate analysis only on the people who had a high score on the anxiety questionnaire. Create a new data frame (in long format) with just the individuals who got 25 or higher. 

subset <- data_Long %>%
  filter(Anxiety >= 25)

```

## Save your work

```{r}
# You should have 5 data frames now (subject level, trial level, combined, long format and the subset). Save them as a new .rda file for future use

save(subjects, trials, data, data_Long, subset, file="Study2_Clean.rda")

```
