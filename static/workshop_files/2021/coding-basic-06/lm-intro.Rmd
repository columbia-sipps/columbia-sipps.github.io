# Plan for today

- what is a linear regression model? (quick review)

- prepping your data for analysis

- using the `lm()` function & interpreting the output

# What is a linear regression model?

> - used to quantify the relationship(s) between an **outcome variable** and one (or more!) **predictors**

> - what this analysis does, more specifically, is **fit a line** that best minimizes the error between that line and your data points

> - when we use R to fit this line, what we get as output of our analysis is an **intercept** and at least one **slope**

> - usually, these **slope** values (also called **betas**) are what we're most interested in: if a slope associated with a given X variable is significantly different than zero, we can conclude that the value of X is meaningfully related to the value of Y

# What is a linear regression model?

> - for example, let's say you are interested in which variables affect how much you'll enjoy a particular take-out restaurant

> - you could hypothesize that your enjoyment will depend on (at least) two things:
>     - the average Yelp rating
>     - whether the restaurant is a pizzeria or a taqueria
  
> - `enjoyment ~ (yelp rating) + (type of restaurant)`

> - if both slopes are significant, we can say that both the yelp rating and the type of restaurant are significantly associated with food enjoyment 

# Types of variables

> - regression models are inherently flexible, and allow you to quantify many different kinds of variables & relationships

> - in our toy model, for example, we are looking at two different types of moderators/predictors: **continuous** (the yelp rating) & **categorical** (the type of restaurant)

# Types of variables

- example results:
```{r, echo = F, fig.height = 1.9, fig.width = 4, fig.align = "center", tidy = F}

set.seed(123)

# fake data frame
food_df <- data.frame(type = rep(c('pizzeria','taqueria'), each = 10),
                      type_num = rep(c(0.5, 1), each = 10),
                      rating = rep(seq(0.5, 5, by = 0.5), 2))
food_df$enjoyment <- food_df$type_num * food_df$rating + rnorm(nrow(food_df), mean = 0, sd = 0.3)
food_df$enjoyment[food_df$type_num == 1] <- 3 + rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 0.5)

food_df_mean <- food_df %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarise(mean_enjoyment = mean(enjoyment))

# plot
p1 <- ggplot(data = food_df_mean, aes(x = type, y = mean_enjoyment, fill = type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', width = 0.8) +
  labs(x = 'restaurant type', y = 'average enjoyment', subtitle = 'categorical') +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
p2 <- ggplot(data = food_df, aes(x = rating, y = enjoyment)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = 'Yelp rating', y = 'average enjoyment', subtitle = 'continuous')

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)

```

# Introducing the `lm()` function

> - `lm()` is a function that allows you to run linear models

> - using it requires two main arguments: (1) the dataframe you want to work with, and (2) the equation of the model you want to run

> - equations follow the format: `Y ~ X1 [+ X2 + X3 + ...]`

> - so we might run: `lm(data = mydata, enjoyment ~ yelp_rating + restaurant_type)`

# Plan for today

- ~~what is a linear regression model?~~ any questions?

- prepping your data for analysis

- using the `lm()` package & interpreting the output

- visualizing your results
